# Ecco Text Generator
A text generator that creates animated GIFs in the style of messages found in the classic video game Ecco the Dolphin. 

# How Was This Made?

The background animation used in this generator incorporates a ripple effect that is also an algorithm
ported from the original games!

Jake ( Twitter: @fiuefey ) for providing numbers and Icelandic character support.

Brad Corrupts ( Twitter: @Reaper_man02 ) who reverse engineered the original Ecco the Dolphin ripple generating algorythm from which he was able to find various effects. Although this generator uses code reverse engineered from Ecco 2, it was Brad's findings that inspired the effect portion of this generator.
